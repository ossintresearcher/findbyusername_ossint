Platforms

The tool uses configurable URL patterns to check profiles. Default platforms include:

GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

Twitter/X, Mastodon (example instance), Instagram

Reddit, StackOverflow

TikTok, Medium

Keybase, HackerNews

YouTube (channel/profile fallback)

Website root check (example.com/@username)

You can add or remove platforms by editing the PLATFORMS dictionary in find_by_username.py.

How it works (brief)

For each platform, the script formats the profile URL using the provided username.

It performs an HTTP GET (or HEAD where appropriate) with a polite User-Agent.

Interprets status codes and response content to determine existence:

200 usually -> exists (further heuristics applied for redirects/404 pages).

404 -> not found.

403/429 -> blocked/rate limited (reported).

Saves results with timestamp, platform, url, http_status, exists, note.
